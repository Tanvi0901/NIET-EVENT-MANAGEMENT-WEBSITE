Elaboration:

Introduction:
In today's fast-paced world, colleges and universities organize a multitude of events ranging from academic conferences and workshops 
to cultural festivals and sports competitions. Managing these events efficiently requires careful planning, seamless coordination, and 
effective record-keeping. The Event Management System for NIET aims to address these needs by providing a user-friendly interface that
facilitates event management and maintenance of event records.

Features and Functionality:
1. Event Creation and Management:
   - The system allows authorized users (event organizers or administrators) to create and manage events within the college.
   - Key event details such as event name, date, time, location, description, and associated resources can be specified.
   - Events can be categorized based on their nature (academic, cultural, sports, etc.) for better organization and searchability.
   - Organizers can also set registration deadlines, maximum participant limits, and pricing (if applicable).

2. Participant Registration:
   - The system enables interested participants to register for events through an intuitive registration form.
   - Participants can provide their personal details, select the events they wish to participate in, and make payments (if required).
   - Email notifications can be sent to participants upon successful registration, providing them with event details and important updates.

3. Event Promotion:
   - The system facilitates event promotion by providing a dedicated event page with event details, schedules, and promotional materials.
   - Organizers can upload event-related documents, such as brochures, posters, or promotional videos, to attract more participants.
   - Social media integration allows for easy sharing of events on various platforms, enhancing visibility and participation.

4. Feedback and Evaluation:
   - Participants can provide feedback and ratings for events they have attended, enabling organizers to assess event success and make improvements for future events.
   - The system also allows organizers to collect feedback from event staff, volunteers, and other stakeholders, ensuring comprehensive evaluation.

5. Reports and Analytics:
   - The system generates various reports and analytics to provide insights into event statistics, such as the number of participants, event popularity, and revenue generated.
   - These reports assist administrators in evaluating the overall success of events and making data-driven decisions for future event planning.

Conclusion:
The Event Management System for NIET, developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JDBC, Servlets, JSP, and Workbench SQL on the Eclipse 
platform, serves as a comprehensive solution for managing and maintaining event records within our college. By automating event-related 
processes and providing a centralized platform, the system simplifies event planning, participant registration, and post-event evaluation. This project empowers NIET to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its event management processes, leading to successful and memorable events for the college community.
